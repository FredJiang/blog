Learn English With Movies

<!--more-->

prework

* Just watch the whole movie as you would do before.
* You could use even subtitles in your own language.
* Just to understand what's happening.

day 1

* Choose the first scene, the first two or three minutes.
* Turn on the subtitles or the captions in English.
* As you listen and read along, write down any words or phrases that you don't know.

day 2

* This time turn the subtitles off.
* No subtitles this time, just listening very carefully.

day 3

* Play one sentence and pause.
* Then you repeat the sentence.
* Then play the next sentence, pause.
* Again, copy what the actors say.
* Use the same emotion as the actors.

day 4

* Copy what the actors are saying, but no pausing this time.
* Again, you can use the English subtitles a few times if this helps you.

day 5

* Again you're going to shadow.
* This time no subtitles, no reading at all,
* Just hearing and speaking at the same time.

day 6

* The next day you can do this again - shadowing, but record yourself.
* Record yourself while you shadow.
