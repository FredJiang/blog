`M-x` then `list-packages`

It will automatically refresh the archive contents.

Then, press `U` to mark all upgradable packages to be upgraded.

Last, press `x` to perform the new updates.

Emacs will then download and install all upgradable packages. It will also ask you whether to delete the old packages.
